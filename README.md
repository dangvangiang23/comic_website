# PrivateProject
## Language: 
- Front end: using CSS, HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap
- Backend: using Tomcat Server, SQL Server, JAVA, Servlet, JSP, JSTL
### Introduction:
- This is a small project of PRJ subject at my 2nd year of university.  We are required to make a private website project to understand about Servlet/JSP.
- Truthfully, I did this tiny project during 1 week so it has so many shortcomings in the practices of formatting code, structuring the project folders
and optimazing codes. The project also lacks a few interesting features... 
#### However, the project has the bare minimum functions for a comic reading website: 
- Login/logout/register
- Comic information and list of chapters
- Images for each chapter
- Navigating chapter function
- Comment
- Search by multiple category/ Search by comic name / Search by author
- View counting for each chapter and the whole comic
- Change user account's infor
### The promising features (when motivation with comics comes again)
- Subscribe comic
- Generate charts of Statistics of views, access
- Improve it with hibernate/spring boot/ API
- Update it online
